HarvardX Data Science Series Capstone Report

This is the code for the _Capstone Report_ used as the final thesis for
 [HarvardX Data Science Series](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH125.9x+2T2018/course/).

This is one-time work and I do not plan to make any more changes.
So I do not expect PRs, but critics and notes are welcomed by means of Issues option.
My work environment is based on Debian derived Linux system, so I may have a trouble supporting problems related to 
other operating systems.
